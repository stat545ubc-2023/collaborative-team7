# Project Description
This repository contains the STAT545 Group Project for Group 7. The members of this group are Raveen Badyal, Ruichen Yao, Fanny Dupont, and Eully Ao. The members worked together to submit the project milestone on September 22nd. The README.md file includes a description of the project. Further, the TEAMWORK.md file is a contract, and it outlines how the team will work together to complete their work. The troubleshooting-1.Rmd file includes a file that the group worked on together to ensure that they could create pull requests to complete their work locally on their computers, and then merge the work on to the main branch of the repository. The code in our repository can be previewed through Github. Also, the code can be downloaded to RStudio.
