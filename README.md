It includes the troubleshooting-1.Rmd file that the group worked on together to ensure that they could create pull requests to complete their work locally on their computers, and then merge the work on to the main branch of the repository. The code in our repository can be previewed through Github. Also, the code can be downloaded to RStudio. The file **Milestone2** includes every document related to the second part of the project such as the "troubleshooting-2.Rmd" file, added on September 26th.
